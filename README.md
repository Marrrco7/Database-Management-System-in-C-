Database management application in C++ that allows handling queries in SQL-like commands, along with datatype validation. With functionalities to create, modify, query, and manage databases. 
To help you get started, I've included a queries.txt file in the repository, which contains several sample queries you can try. 
These queries demonstrate how to create, modify, and query the database using the application's supported syntax.

Feel free to explore and modify the queries to suit your needs
